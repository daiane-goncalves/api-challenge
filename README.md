A RESTful API to serve as the backend for a public message board

# Objective

Design and build a RESTful API to serve as the backend for a public message board. It should
support the following features:

● A client can create a message in the service
● A client can modify their own messages
● A client can delete their own messages
● A client can view all messages in the service

Use an in-memory solution for storing any data for this service. Consider the appropriate HTTP
verbs, headers and responses to use.

You should also include tests to assert the correctness of your solution.
